# belly-button-challenge
This project was completed for the UC Davis Bootcamp without the help from my classmates, and with some tears and frustration. I did obtain code from https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_font_comicsansms in order to help me change the font to Comic Sans for the web page.
